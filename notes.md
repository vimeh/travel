# Travel

## Where in Europe should we go (aside from Amsterdam?)
- Using machine learning to decide where to vacatiom
- Need a list of all the cities in Europe, with features and what not preferably
- Then rank them on 1-5
- Gather some heuristics about the top ranked
- Re rank them based on those heurisitics applied
- Sort
- Alternatively, side by side comparison 


### List of all the cities
- So this is kind of hard to find just a list
- would it be easier to geographically search all the keywords... no.
- Let's start here: https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000%40public/information/?disjunctive.cou_name_en&sort=name
    - Only 26,000 downloads? that feels like too few! 
    - maybe folks are accessing it more through the APIs. that would make sense for application
